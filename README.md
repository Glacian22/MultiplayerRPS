Rock paper scissors, online 2 player mode

### The goal
Using firebase, create a version of rock-paper-scissors that can connect two players

### Technologies used
HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Firebase, JQuery

### Current issues
Haven't added any onDisconnect functionality, so after a game between two players, the player count on the server must be manually set back to zero. Also haven't added any sort of "play again" for when a game is finished. It would also be good to have chat.
