Make HTML skeleton

Initialize firebase

For only a single 2 player session, have counter on firebase numPlayers

if numPlayers doesn't exist, make it and set to 1

if it does exist, increment to 2

while numPlayers is 1, display "waiting for another player"

when a second player joins, start game

use firebase onDisconnect to detect a dropout, decrement numPlayers

Once game starts, player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors via graphics

choice gets pushed to firebase

opponent's choice gets pulled from firebase and compared to player's choice

score variable either increments or stays the same

if score equals victory, display VICTORY and update firebase with victory

client tracks both scores, and can display victory or loss
